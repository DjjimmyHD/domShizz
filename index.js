// Create 2 variables and use getElementsByTagName to select the h1 and img tags.

// PART TWO
// The time of the bears ruling things is over. Lets use DOM manipulation to give power
// to our true overlords CORGIS

// Lets start by changing the text of the H1 to read "CORGIS!"
// Don't forget to select the h1 before trying to change the text


// Do the same thing with the paragraph tag. It should read
// "Two types of corgi lords Pembroke and Cardigan"

// Cool we are on our way to spreading the good news about our new
// overlords but the site needs more work

// Lets change the image source to be a picture of a corgi of your choosing

// Lets change the class of the lis to be "corgitype"

// Now set the text of each li to be Pembroke and Cardigan

// Change the color of the H1 to be your favorite color

// STRETCH IT OUT

//  Use this portion to cretae more images of corgis or more corgi 
// related things. Maybe you want to have a collab take over and add
// cats or brids also taking over. Use this section to create new elements
// And add then to our corgi page
